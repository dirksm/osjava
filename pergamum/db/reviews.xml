  <review isbn="1590592832">
   <p>This is the first book available on Jakarta Commons. Every released Commons component at time of print is covered and there are numerous examples. </p>
   <p>Note, I do have a certain level of self-interest in this as I was a technical reviewer on the book. </p>
   <p>After a brief introduction, the author, Harshad Oak, covers the Lang, Logging, Validator, BeanUtils, Pool/DBCP, Digester, Collections/Primitives, HttpClient/FileUpload and Net components, with a chapter on each and then finishes up with a quick overview of DbUtils, Codec, JXPath and Discovery in an ultimate chapter. </p>
   <p>There are other Jakarta Commons books on the way, and this book is ideal for the newbie to Jakarta Commons. I'll be ensuring my workplace has a copy. </p>
