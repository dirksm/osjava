In fact, components are not big applications, but sleek code bits that perform specific tasks very well. This book provides much-needed documentation and usage information about the popular sub-projects forming Jakarta Commons-so that you can efficiently incorporate them into Java applications. </description></div><div class="publisher">(<span class="publisher-name"><a href="http://www.apress.com/">Apress</a></span> - <span class="publisher-date">2004-03</span>)</div><br/><div class="books-links"><span class="ext"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1590592832">[amz]</a></span> / <span class="ext"><a href="http://www.bookpool.com/.x/1/sm/1590592832">[bkp]</a></span> / <span class="ext"><a href="http://www.javashelf.com/servlet/books/1590592832">[jshf]</a></span></div><br/><div class="sub-title">Review(s)</div><br/><div class="review-text"><review isbn="1590592832" author="Stephen Colebourne">

   <p>This is the first book available on Jakarta Commons. Every released Commons component at time of print is covered and there are numerous examples. </p>
   <p>Note, I do have a certain level of self-interest in this as I was a technical reviewer on the book. </p>
   <p>After a brief introduction, the author, Harshad Oak, covers the Lang, Logging, Validator, BeanUtils, Pool/DBCP, Digester, Collections/Primitives, HttpClient/FileUpload and Net components, with a chapter on each and then finishes up with a quick overview of DbUtils, Codec, JXPath and Discovery in an ultimate chapter. </p>
   <p>There are other Jakarta Commons books on the way, and this book is ideal for the newbie to Jakarta Commons. I'll be ensuring my workplace has a copy. </p>
