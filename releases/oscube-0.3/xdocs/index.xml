       <p>OSCube is a framework of sorts. I find myself writing a particular type of application, some kind of job engine, repeatedly and OSCube is the generic version there-of. It uses Simple-JNDI, and therefore really just basic JNDI, as its configuration system, and the Quartz scheduler for Cron-work. </p>
       <p>Much of the code is refactored out of scraping-engine, whose next version will depend on OSCube, while an unreleased project named Simuchron (real-time value simulator), also uses it. </p>
