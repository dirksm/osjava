        TigThreads is an extention of the Threading API that comes with a 
        standard Java SDK.  The project started from the inability, under
        the standard implementation, to access specific Threads in a 
        ThreadGroup, and it grew from there.
      </p>
      <p>
      	In this initial release of TigThreads, it is possible to utilize
      	Threads and ThreadGroups in a more sane manner than in the default
      	implementation, utilizing the ThreadManager, by accessing them by
      	their names, which must be unique (at least within a particular 
      	ThreadGroup.
     </p>
     <p>
       Are TigThreads done?  Hardly.  There are still more features that need
       to be added.  See the Pending Tasks (or the Roadmap in the bug pages) 
       for details.
