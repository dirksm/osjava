  <section name="Trail-Taglib">
    <p>Trail Taglib allows a dynamic breadcrumbs trail to be built up and records a user's movements for the entire session, while providing a normalized version to display to the user. </p>

    <p>It uses http-referer headers to guess when the user has hit the back button and correctly understands when a server-side forward has happened under servlet 2.4 containers. A filter is provided which emulates the servlet 2.4 functionality in pre 2.4 containers. </p>

    <p>The dependencies listed are only required to build, not to run the taglib, and the tld file is a part of the jar file. </p>
