    <p>Version 0.3 has been released, as of 2003-02-14. The following features were added: </p>
<ul>
<li>Implemented a protocol system for the simple-jndi root's location. The original file location was retrofitted into this and a classpath location was added. A http location is planned</li>
<li>If a protocol is unspecified, then resort to v0.2 format, ie) file://</li>
<li>If root is unspecified, then use the classpath</li>
<li>The delimiter in the search values is configurable, so people can more easily mimic LDAP</li>
</ul>
