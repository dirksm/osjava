  <section name="Why use Simple-JNDI?">
    <p>The biggest reason to use Simple-JNDI is in the name, it's simple. No matter which text file option you choose, it creates an easy to edit database for your JNDI. Coupled with SJ's in-memory JNDI implementation and your unit tests or simple application can easily get its required infrastructure with minimal effort. </p>
