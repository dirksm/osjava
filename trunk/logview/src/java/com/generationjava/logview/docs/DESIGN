Report -> Renderer => Some form of specific output




QUESTIONS?
==========

Should Reportlet's be Pipeable? 

How would one create say a TableReport, and then sort it by a 
column somehow. Would a BarChartReport or a PieChartReport be 
sortable? Equally, is a BarChart different to a PieChart or Table?

  YES. BarChart is different. etc.

Or create a TableReport with counts in it and then show it in a 
percent way?  THIS IS A LOGLET. PercentLoglet?

Should a Log have a LogEvent called header? How 
would a Reportlet know about this?
