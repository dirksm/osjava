<CENTER> <div class='NavBarCell1'>What is this all about?</div> </CENTER>
<p>This is a Multidoc system. It consists of a wrapper around a set of javadocs.</p>

<CENTER> <div class='NavBarCell1'>Why does it exist?</div> </CENTER>
<p>First and foremost, to put all of Jakarta Commons into a single javadoc, possibly all of Apache/Jakarta if desired. Also should be useful for other locations; osjava, codehaus etc. </p>

<CENTER> <div class='NavBarCell1'>How does it work?</div> </CENTER>
<p>The current version scrapes from a list of javadoc urls and collates a small set of pages around those pages. </p>

<CENTER> <div class='NavBarCell1'>Future?</div> </CENTER>
<ul>
<li>Add a categorization scheme so all of Apache fits. Projects should be able to be in multiple categories. </li>
<li>Needs to maintain a state so it doesn't have to keep downloading all pages just because a new one is added.</li>
<li>It would be nice if it would also pull down and collate an index.</li>
<li>It would be very nice to integrate a search into the project-frame.</li>
<li>Improve the HTML as the current one is quite hacked from the javadoc style. </li>
<li>Integrate Clover</li>
<li>Mavenise and produce an executable jar</li>
<li>Release on osjava.org</li>
</ul>
