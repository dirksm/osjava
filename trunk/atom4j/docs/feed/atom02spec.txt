- namespace: http://purl.org/atom/ns#
- top-level element: feed

feed element

required attributes of feed:
- @version.  currently the only acceptable value is 0.2.  (0.1 is obsolete and 
should not be used.)

optional attributes of feed:
- xml:lang.  SHOULD be included.  MAY be overwritten on individual entries, if 
the feed contains entries in more than one language.

required children of feed:
- title.  occurs 1.  xsd:string.  "dc:title".  if this feed describes a 
website, SHOULD be the title of the website.
- link.  occurs 1.  xsd:anyURI.  "the link to the website described by this 
feed".  if this feed describes a website, SHOULD be a link to the homepage of 
the website.
- modified.  occurs 1.  W3DTF.  "dcterms:modified".  the modification date of 
the feed, including any changes to any of the listed entries.  SHOULD be UTC.
- author.  no content, but has subchildren, see below.  occurs 0 or 1.  at 
least one of the following MUST be true: 1. feed contains author; 2. every 
entry contains author.  if feed contains author and entry does not, the feed's 
author element is inherited and applies to that entry.  if both a feed and an 
entry within the feed contain an author, the entry's author overrides the 
feed's author.  every entry MUST have exactly one author.

optional children of feed:
- tagline.  occurs 0 or 1.  xsd:string.  "dc:description".  "a short 
human-readable tagline for this feed".  examples: "All the news that's fit to 
print" (tagline of NYT).
- id.  occurs 0 or 1.  xsd:anyURI.  "permanent, globally unique ID of this 
feed."  MUST NOT change, ever, even if the feed is moved to a new server.  for 
this reason, it probably shouldn't be the same as feed/link, although it MAY 
be.  we're currently discussing options, including <http://www.taguri.org/> and 
GUID in the COM/CORBA sense.
- generator.  occurs 0 or 1.  xsd:anyURI.  "URI of the toolkit that generated 
this feed."  SHOULD be home page of toolkit/program/hosting provider, example 
http://www.movabletype.org/.  MAY include version number, example: 
http://www.movabletype.org/?v=2.64.
  - generator optional attribute: @name.  xsd:string.  "human-readable name of 
the toolkit that generated this feed".  example: name="Movable Type"
- copyright.  occurs 0 or 1.  xsd:string.  "dc:rights".  "human-readable 
copyright statement for this feed."  for machine-readable licensing 
information, producers SHOULD use an extension module (to be defined).
- entry.  see below
- contributor.  occurs 0 or more.  no content, but has children, see below

author element

required children of author:
- name.  occurs 1.  xsd:string.  "dc:creator" of feed or entry (depending on 
where author element is).  MAY be name of corporation, if there are no 
individual authors or publisher does not wish to make their names available.  
see <http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Authors>

optional children of author:
- url.  occurs 0 or 1.  xsd:anyURI.  "the URL of this author".
- email.  occurs 0 or 1.  whatever standard defines email address syntax, 
including plus signs and other allowable weird characters.  "the email address 
of this author".

entry element - no content, no attributes (other than optional xml:lang)

required children of entry:

- title.  occurs 1.  xsd:string.  "dc:title"
- link.  occurs 1.  xsd:anyURI.  "permanent link to a representation of this 
entry".  is NOT defined as "link to an external resource described in the 
content of this entry".  MUST be permanent.  MUST be globally unique.  MUST be 
clickable (not sure how to express this, perhaps "use an IANA-registered 
protocol and point to a resource that is viewable by ... uh, something)
- id.  occurs 1.  xsd:anyURI.  "dc:identifier".  "permanent globally unique ID 
of this entry".  MUST be permanent, MUST be globally unique.  MAY be same as 
link.  current recommendations are under active discussion, same issues as 
feed/id.
- issued.  occurs 1.  W3DTF minus timezone requirement.  "dcterms:issued".  
SHOULD include timezone.  SHOULD be expressed in publisher's local timezone.  
MAY skip timezone (LiveJournal requirement).
- modified.  W3DTF.  "dcterms:modified".  SHOULD be UTC.

optional children of entry:

- created.  occurs 0 or 1.  W3DTF.  "dcterms:created".  SHOULD be UTC.  if not 
present, its value is presumed to be identical to modified.
- summary.  occurs 0 or 1.  xsd:string.  "dc:description".  "short summary, 
blurb, or excerpt about this entry".  MUST be plain text (i.e. no escaped 
HTML).  examples of use: lead on first page of news site.
- author.  see above
- contributor.  occurs 0 or more.  no content, but has children, see below
- content.  occurs 0 or more.  see below

contributor element

same required and optional elements as author.  name is "dc:contributor", url 
and email are the same as in author.

content element

required attributes:

- @type.  MIME type.  "format of this content"

optional attributes:

- xml:lang.
- @mode.  'xml', 'escaped', or 'base64'.  "method using to encode this 
content".  if 'xml', value is inline xml (probably namespaced XHTML).  if 
'escaped', value is an escaped xsd:string which consumers MUST unescap and 
treat as @type.  if 'base64', value is base64-encoded which consumers MUST 
base64-decode and treat as @type.

if content @type="multipart/alternative", @mode MUST NOT be specified, and 
content element MUST contain 1 or more content elements.  These content 
elements MUST NOT specify @type="multipart/alternative" (i.e. only one level of 
nesting is allowed).  Consumers SHOULD look at all alternative content elements 
and determine which one is most suitable, based on which @type and @mode the 
consumer supports, and preferences specified by the end user (if any).  
Consumers SHOULD NOT render more than one content alternative.
