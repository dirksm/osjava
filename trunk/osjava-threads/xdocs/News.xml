    <section name="OSJava-Threads 2.0">
        <p>Version 2.0 was released on 2004-10-??.  This is a significant
            version upgrade and there are several combat busters.  It is 
            recommended, however, that you upgrade because versions previous.
            to this one will not be supported, in large part, due to the 
            complete architectural change.

        Version 1.1 was released on 2003-05-19.
	<li>
	  <ul>
	    Fixed an bug that occurred in the instantiation of the 
	    ThreadManager. (TIGTHD-1)
	  </ul>
	  <ul>
	    Fixed an bug where there was a slight chance that multiple 
	    ThreadManager Objects could be created in multi-threaded 
	    environments (and that is the point isn't it?) (TIGTHD-3)
	  </ul>
	  <ul>
	    Cleaned up the code in general to better comply with the Java
	    Coding Guidelines.  Checkstyle reports only minor spacing 
	    pickiness issues which I don't agree with. :)

      <p>
        Version 1.0 was released on 2003-05-12.  This is an initial release.
        Using 1.0 as the initial release may or may not be considered a 
        mistake, (I'm looking for feedback on that actually), but I have used 
        most of this library before, and I'm reasonably confident in it.
