Now has a .xml file for configuration.

Need to have some kind of file for the persitent data concerning a build. 
It would record:

Last build state.
Last build time.
Last build reason (cvs update files etc).
Reports generation state.


Need to start using perl OO. Make an object for each .xml file.
So Config class and State class. Config->new("xmlfile") etc.
