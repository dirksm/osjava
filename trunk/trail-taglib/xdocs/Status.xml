  <section name="Status of Trail-Taglib">
    <p>Trail Taglib is now written. It allows a dynamic breadcrumbs trail to be built up and records a user's movements for the entire session, while providing a normalized version to display to the user. </p>

    <p>It uses http-referer headers to guess when the user has hit the back button and correctly understands when a server-side forward has happened under servlet 2.4 containers. A filter is provided which emulates the servlet 2.4 functionality in pre 2.4 containers. </p>
   </section>

  <section name="Todo for Trail-Taglib">
    <p>Create a session report object that turns the trail into a report. Or just have the developer write a JSP page?</p>
    <p>Create a session listener which evaluates a JSP page(?) and mails it to the user on session expiry.</p>
