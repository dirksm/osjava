Trail Taglib is now written. It allows a dynamic breadcrumbs trail to be built 
up and records a user's movements for the entire session, while providing a 
normalized version to display to the user.

It uses http-referer headers to guess when the user has hit the back button 
and correctly understands when a server-side forward has happened under 
servlet 2.4 containers. A filter is provided which emulates the servlet 2.4 
functionality in pre 2.4 containers.

Todo:

Create a session report object that turns the trail into a report. Or just 
have the developer write a JSP page?
Create a session listener which evaluates a JSP page(?) and mails it to the 
user on session expiry.
