Currently has a couple of bugs:

1) Pages which do server-side redirecting/forwarding do not have 
   their urls correctly figured out.

   Solution is:
     i) Spec allows a parameter to be obtained to get the real thing
    ii) Use a filter
   iii) Hack a way into Struts [not good]

2) Referrer's need to be checked to see if someone has hit 
   back and then a page.
