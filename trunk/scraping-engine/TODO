Hide Config behind Session??

Implement Store
   using hsqldb   [DONE. Needs testing]
Implement Notification
   [DONE. Needs implementation of EmailNotifier]
Implement Scheduler
   [DONE. Does not fulfill all requirements yet]
:::
All must be pluggable

Implement a 'REPLACE' statement style Store, which tries an update, then 
an insert. or vice-versa.

Different threads for db than io??  Is this automatic when using Quartz?

ClassLoader for parsers
  Need to be able to redeploy a parser without having to restart
  Use JMX for this???

Scheduler needs to check config to figure out if it should reschedule

Schedulers need to understand:

cron
'startup'
interval based
[ALL DONE]
Also need to understand the concept of:  Run until success or Time.

Pages need to know their URIs

CheckingParsers need to be thought about. 
Sometimes the Check might want to be a lot of times.
Maybe a Checker exists, but not a CheckingParser. So Parsers 
can call Checkers.

Or:  A Parser has a precondition/postcondition. These are the checkers.

Specify a Page content-type. ie) loose html, xhtml, csv, xml, xls etc. 
  This would lead to a sub-class of Page in reply

Long-term:

Provide a scraping language
Provide a design GUI
Provide an automatic analyser. Looks for tables with high levels of 
content. Looks for comments etc.
