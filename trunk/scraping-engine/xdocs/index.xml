    <section name="Scraping-engine - so what is it?">
      <p>I've been playing for a while with an engine to make web-site scraping nice and easy, without trying to suggest that it is simple to do the scrape. This scraping-engine is aimed to be a framework to improve the speed of development and provide stability. </p>
      <p>It's intended to not just be a scraper, but to be able to do other robot-like things. One tool I plan to release is a link-checker. </p>

      <p>A full example is available (<a href="http://www.osjava.org/releases/official/scraping-engine/scraping-examples-for-0.3.tar.gz">scraping-examples-for-0.3.tar.gz</a>) from the download directory, and the example is available in <a href="http://svn.osjava.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/trunk/scraping-engine/src/examples/Comics/">subversion</a>. </p>
