      <p>I've been playing for a while with an engine to make web-site scraping nice and easy, without trying to suggest that it is simple to do the scrape. This scraping-engine is aimed to be a framework to improve the speed of development and provide stability. </p>
      <p>It's intended to not just be a scraper, but to be able to do other robot-like things. One tool I plan to release is a link-checker. </p>

    <section name="Early days">
      <p>The initial release, 0.1, is an immature codebase that needs to be used in various situations. If all goes to plan, I intend to use it in said situations and mature the code. Various other release based on the engine will occur, so expect the site to switch from a single-project to a multi-project. </p>
