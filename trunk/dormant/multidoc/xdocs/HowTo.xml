  <section name="Using Multidoc">
   <p>Using Multidoc is currently done by copying the examples in SVN. </p>
   <p>Assuming a unix-like shell, the following will multidoc Jakarta Commons:<br/>
     <code>./run.sh commons-release.cfg commons-multidoc/</code><br/>
     The first argument is the configuration file, the second is the target directory 
     to put values in. Note that the run.sh script copies everything from docs/ into 
     the target directory as well, though this is increasingly getting smaller. </p>
   <p>To multidoc your own system, just copy one of the included configuration files and 
   customise it to fit your needs. It is hopefully quite obvious in use. </p>
