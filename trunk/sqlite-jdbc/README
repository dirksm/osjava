This project is a jdbc driver for the SQLite package.  The reasons for it are 
to provide a jdbc driver for SQLite that implements the JDBC 3 (maybe 4) 
spec as much as possible.

This is a Type 2 driver.  This is necessary because SQLite is not net
enabled.  Utilizing the SQLite API becomes necessary at this point.

This driver supports SQLite 3.  If it is conveneint, SQLite 2 support may be
added in the future.
