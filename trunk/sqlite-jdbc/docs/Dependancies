Dependancies for Building
-------------------------
* Java 1.4 or above, though this may eventually be elevated to Java 5 as a 
  minimum.
* SQLite 3.2.2+
  * sqlite3_db_handle() is a required method.
  * sqlite3_get_autocommit() is a required method (or will be)
* Ant (1.6.5 tested)
  * Optional javah task
* Gcc or other Ansi C compliant compiler for building the JNI portion.  There
  are plans in the future to support building with cl in Windows.
