* Java_org_osjava_jdbc_sqlite_Statement_executeSQLWithResultSet needs to 
  be improved to not generate a new sqlite3_stmt object if there is already 
  on associated with the ResultSet.  

* Driver.getConnection(). JNI portion.  
  Determine the message that the exception will throw if the 'create' property
  is passed and it does not match with the settings.  (I.e. "Never" is the
  value of the property and the file does not already exist.)
    
* Driver.getConnection().  Utilize passed properties where appropriate.

* Consider extending SQLException in more specific classes so that they are 
  easier to catch without having to parse the message of the exception.
  When this is done, it will be important that the new exception classes 
  extend SQLException, so the spec remains in tact.  Additionally the error
  messages should stay the same as before, for backwards compatability.

TESTS TO CREATE
* closing a connection where the database will be busy
* closing a connection when it's already closed (There's java in place to 
  prevent this though)
* ResultSetMetadata tests.
