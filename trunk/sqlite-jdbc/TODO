* I'm not sure that the way that I'm passing around the handler is really all
  that good.  It should work, as it's just an integer, but I'm concerned about
  static analysis type tools actually detecting whether or not things are 
  properly freed, and in fact whether it's going to be leaking memory at all.

* Driver.getConnection(). JNI portion.  
  Determine the message that the exception will throw if the 'create' property
  is passed and it does not match with the settings.  (I.e. "Never" is the
  value of the property and the file does not already exist.)
    
* Driver.getConnection().  Utilize passed properties where appropriate.

* Consider extending SQLException in more specific classes so that they are 
  easier to catch without having to parse the message of the exception.
  When this is done, it will be important that the new exception classes 
  extend SQLException, so the spec remains in tact.  Additionally the error
  messages should stay the same as before, for backwards compatability.

TESTS TO CREATE
* closing a connection where the database will be busy
* closing a connection when it's already closed (There's java in place to 
  prevent this though)
