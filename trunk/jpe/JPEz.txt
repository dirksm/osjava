From the JIRA project for JPEz (JPE for the Zaurus):

* Machines do not include Zaurus. Add two Z form factors?

* Compilation fails as tools.jar does not work on Z. 
  Need to switch to a command line compilation method, rather than using the tools.jar Javac. This needs to be pluggable.
  Plug in compiler system written. Needs testing on the zaurus at some point.

* Unable to run Java programs on the Z
  Nothing happens when you run the class. God knows why.

* IPKG package lacks icon

* Fonts don't do change
  They do on the Mac though, so a Z thing

* JPEz icon opens up in PDA mode
  You can only open in clam shell mode if you type jpe on the command line. Why??
  If you hold down on icon, and turn off magnify, then it opens fine.
  So how to put this in the install package?

* Pluggable tab completion
  Need to co-opt the tab key for completing text. This would be looked up against a properties file of some kind.

* IPKG plugin
  Take the Deploy app + new genjava-ipkg package and integrate them into JPEz.

* jpe.properties is too much of a pain
  The jpe.properties needs to be in the CLASSPATH. It wasn't before due to psion bugs.
  This now loads using the correct ResourceBundle system.
  This is not working correctly, so re-opening it until it is satisfactorily fixed.
