        Version 1.1 was released on 2003-05-19.
	<li>
	  <ul>
	    Fixed an bug that occurred in the instantiation of the 
	    ThreadManager. (TIGTHD-1)
	  </ul>
	  <ul>
	    Fixed an bug where there was a slight chance that multiple 
	    ThreadManager Objects could be created in multi-threaded 
	    environments (and that is the point isn't it?) (TIGTHD-3)
	  </ul>
	  <ul>
	    Cleaned up the code in general to better comply with the Java
	    Coding Guidelines.  Checkstyle reports only minor spacing 
	    pickiness issues which I don't agree with. :)

      <p>
        Version 1.0 was released on 2003-05-12.  This is an initial release.
        Using 1.0 as the initial release may or may not be considered a 
        mistake, (I'm looking for feedback on that actually), but I have used 
        most of this library before, and I'm reasonably confident in it.
