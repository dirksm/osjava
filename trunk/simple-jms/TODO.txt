From the now defunct JIRA:

* MessageWatcher.run needs a yield
  having a thread that just goes round in a tight loop can really hammer the processor. best practice it to at least put a yield in.. if not a short sleep

* Slow down configuration?
  Simple-JMS is going to be very fast. You might want to make it run slower so you can get a better feel for the speed issues :)

* JMS Spec
  Find URL to latest JMS Spec.
  Currently we're implementing the one in J2EE 1.4

* Understand how to use StreamMessage and BytesMessage
  Weird classes. We need to figure out how we use them on the client side so we can figure out how to use them on the server side.
