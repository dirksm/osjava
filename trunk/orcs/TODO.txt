From the now delete JIRA project:

* Select data row -> Show which revision that row is in the revision list
  Possibly not just selecting that row, possibly the background colour would change.

* Show differences between revisions
  Possibly by selecting more than one revision in the revision list.

* Login panel needs to get focus when it starts up
  When you choose the db and the login panel is shown, focus needs to be on the login textfield.
