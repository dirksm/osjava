  <div class="sub-title">Purpose of the site?</div>
  <p>This site is designed to provide information on open-source Java books. </p>
  <div class="sub-title">What's with the name?</div>
  <p>Pergamum was a city in southern Turkey which was a competitor to the Great Library in Alexandria. The Egyptians put an export embargo on papyrus to protect themselves from a brain drain and so Pergamum invented the art of writing on animal skins. This is where we get the name parchment. </p>
  <div class="sub-title">What are the [amz] parts?</div>
  <p>These are links to external sites:
    <ul>
      <li>[amz] is amazon.com</li>
      <li>[bkp] is bookpool.com</li>
      <li>[jshf] is javashelf.com</li>
    </ul></p>
  <p>Every book has a link, but the book may not be available on said shopping site. They're just blindly linked on what is assumed to be an ISBN. </p>
  <div class="sub-title">Thanks to...</div>
  <p>The look and feel of the site was donated by Tim Vernum, and some tweaks later suggested by Jason Jones. </p>
  <div class="sub-title">Legal...</div>
  <p>Obviously any information concerning a book itself are owned by the publishers and authors. Reviews and any other content of this site is copyrighted to Henri Yandell. No apes were insulted or consulted during the making of this site. </p>
