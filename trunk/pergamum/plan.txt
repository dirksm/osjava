Assemble ISBN's for books under category/sub-category
Pull these from an xml file: db.xml.

This should then talk to Amazon's web service? To get the information 
about those books, apply an xsl? and create a series of html files.

Amazon's web service is bad. Enforces I link to them and only them.
So apply an xsl to an xml db. Add the names of the books later.

The db is now split into multiple files. book.xml, categories.xml, publishers.xml
There now exists a view-namespace of sorts with an xsl to convert xml-content files into html files, by pulling the data into the files from the database files.

Splitting things up so I can do my front page out of various pages. Unsure how the hell that will work :)

Need to create a page for every book, category and publisher.
