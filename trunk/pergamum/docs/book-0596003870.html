   <p>Subtitled "Extreme Programming in the Real World", this cookbook makes a good introduction to a slew of open-source projects that are of use both by the Extreme Programming (XP) brigade, and by any other Java project. Whilst chapter one introduces us to the real subject of the book, XP Tools, the second chapter is a tiny introduction to XP and largely ignorable. Following from there the book enters the cookbook mode and has chapters on Ant, JUnit, HttpUnit, Mock Objects, Cactus, JUnitPerf and XDoclet. It finishes with a chapter on Tomcat and JBoss which is really a very basic introduction to their administration. </p>
   <p>The Perl Cookbook was an outstanding book. One of the best of the last decade, and since then O'Reilly have continually tried to recreate that quality with various releases in the Cookbook series. I'm not aware of any book which has managed to match it, but there's been nothing to match the classic Programming Perl and Learning Perl combination either. Anyone who has bought the Java Cookbook will be aware of how hit and miss the Cookbook series is. What makes the Perl Cookbook so good is that it is a subject that many of us do a little bit of the time. Therefore when I hit my head for the Nth time and try to recall how you do substrings in Perl, it's just a recipe away. This is not something I would say of this book. </p>
   <p>While the chapters do have recipes, they don't assume familiarity with the subjects in question and so the first 3 or 4 recipes are wasted on how to setup and start using the subject matter. If I'm a user of JUnit already, or have read a good article, I already know the first 5 recipes just to have a working system. There are on average 13 recipes per chapter, and with 4 of these being startup, that's a lot of the book wasted. </p>
   <p>The last chapter is especially weak when it comes to the Cookbook style. Although it's lined up as a series of recipes, it's really just a list of ways to deploy in Tomcat, and a couple of pages on JBoss. </p>
   <p>Despite this diatribe of negativity concerning its quality as a Cookbook, the book's content is actually very good. It rarely turns into reams of code (there's one bad part in the Tomcat section) and as an O'Reilly book has the nice type-setting for the code it does have, with bold text to signify the part of the code to focus on. The recipe structure helps to keep the book evenly structured and the Problem/Solution/Discussion/See Also breakdown of an O'Reilly recipe keeps the concept within understanding; much like a Gang of Four pattern. </p>
   <p>All in all, I'd recommend this book as a good primer to the technologies listed. Buy it to read on the train, or on holiday, don't buy it to be an essential desk-side reference. </p>
   <p><strong>Suggested retitle</strong>: Managing Java Code with Open-Source tools. </p>
   <p><strong>Competition</strong>: <a href="book-047120708X.html">Java Tools for eXtreme Programming</a>. I'd rate this as the better read. </p>
