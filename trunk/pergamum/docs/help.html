  <div class="sub-title">What's with the name?</div>
  <p>Pergamum was a city in southern Turkey which was a competitor to the Great Library in Alexandria. The Egyptians put an export embargo on papyrus to protect themselves from a brain drain and so Pergamum invented the art of writing on animal skins. This is where we get the name parchment. </p>
