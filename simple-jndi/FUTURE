make dependent on jakarta sandbox convert
also on gj-xml and gj-core [though would be nice to remove gj-core]
possibly remove commons-lang dep, as I only use a handful of StringUtils meths
commons-collections can go whenever commons-convert is moved to
genjava-core can goto gj-xml whenever it's ready, gj-core unneeded as long as 
commons-convert moved to

package as a zip with all jars needed in it

Examples:

Need a page for:
   Faking a DataSource via .properties
   Faking a DataSource via .xml
   Faking a DataSource via .ini

   Placing a resource on the classpath
   Placing a resource on http
   Placing a resource in a file

   Changing the delimiter

   Implementing a configuration system
