        <release version="2.0" date="2004-10-??">
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="update" issue="TGT-2">
                COMPAT BUSTER:Refactored the package from org.tigransoft to
                org.osjava, and renamed the package from TigThreads to 
                OSJava-Threads.
            </action>
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="fix" issue="TGT-3">
                COMPAT BUSTER: Renamed getAbort() methods to isAborting() in
                all classes.
            </action>
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="update" issue="TGT-4">
                Improved API to work better with threads that implement 
                ExtendedRunnable, but do not extend ExtendedThread.
            </action>
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="update" issue="TGT-5">
                AbstractExtendedRunnable, and ExtendedThread are made 
                uncloneable.
            </action>
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="add">
                Added the exception InvalidRunnableException
            </action>
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="update">
                Added mechanism to notify managed Threads that are in a wait 
                state and wake them up safely.  The necessary synchronization
                is done and it doesn't require looking up the actual thread 
                object, as it's done by name.
            </action>
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="add">
                COMPAT BUSTER: Added ThreadContext to replace 
                ExtendedThreadGroup and ThreadManager.  This is a more 
                flexible means of handling the grouping and management of 
                Threads.  This created a dependancy on Simple-JNDI.
            </action>
            <action dev="rzigweid" type="remove">
                COMPAT BUSTER: Removed ExtendedThreadGroup, ThreadManager, 
                InvalidThreadGroupParentException, 
                InvalidThreadParentException.
            </action>
