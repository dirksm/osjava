        OSJava-Threads is an extention of the Threading API that comes with a
        standard Java SDK. The project started from the inability, under the
        standard implementation, to access specific Threads in a ThreadGroup,
        and it grew from there.
      </p>
      <p>
      	This is the initial release of this package under the OSJava-Threads,
        name. Much has changed from that which it derived, TigThreads.
        Firstly, the concept of a ThreadGroup is something that should never
        be used. Instead context objects are used to create, control, and
        eventaully destroy threads. This context can be implemented as a
        subcontext of another context, if that's allowed by the parent
        context. Just bind it in.
     </p>
     <p>
       Is the OSJava-Threads package done? Hardly. There are still more
       features that need to be added. See the <a href="Tasks.html">Pending 
       Tasks</a> (or the Roadmap in the bug pages) for details.
