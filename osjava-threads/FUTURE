This file represents a list of some of the ideas for future plans that 
I have for the OSJava-Threads project.

In Progress:
 * Eliminating ThreadManager and replacing it with ThreadContext.
 * Refactored from TigThreads to OSJava-Threads for proper inclusion
   into the OSJava Framework
 * Integration with Simple-JNDI as part of the above process.
 * Proper utilization and creation of subcontexts
 
Further down the road:
 * Deprecate ExtendedThreadGroup.  We're going to try to function without them
   Completely, instead relying upon ThreadContexts
 * Write Unit Tests for the projects.
