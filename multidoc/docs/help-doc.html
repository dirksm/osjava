<CENTER> <H1>What is this all about?</H1> </CENTER>
This is a MetaJavadoc system. It consists of a wrapper around a set of javadocs.

<CENTER> <H1>Why does it exist?</H1> </CENTER>
First and foremost, to put all of Jakarta Commons into a single javadoc, possibly all of Apache/Jakarta if desired. Also should 
be useful for other locations; osjava, codehaus etc.

<CENTER> <H1>How does it work?</H1> </CENTER>
The current version scrapes from a list of javadoc urls and collates a small set of pages around those pages. 

<CENTER> <H1>Future?</H1> </CENTER>
Needs to maintain a state so it doesn't have to keep downloading all pages just because a new one is added.<br>
It would be nice if it would also pull down and collate an index.<br>
It would be very nice to integrate a search into the project-frame.<br>
Choosing a project should change all three other windows, not just the one. JavaScript time. <br>
Need to be able to configure from a configuration, currently hard-coded. <br>
Would be nice to configure a few things about the multidoc site. Name, description etc, that would go in titles and on the multi-overview.<br>
Improve the HTML as the current one is quite hacked from the javadoc style. <br>
Add a categorization scheme so all of Apache fits. Projects should be able to be in multiple categories. <br>
