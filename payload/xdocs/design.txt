Payload is two parts. The second part is currently implemented and is 
PayloadExtractor, which deploys the payload and performs search and replace 
using a supplied properties file.

For optimisation, PayloadExtractor will know the files it should search 
and replace on, currently it just acts on .txt and .xml files.

A payload'd jar looks like:

META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
com/generationjava/payload/PayloadExtractor.class
payload/<payload>

and is then run with:
java -jar <the-jar>.jar interpolate.properties

The first part to Payload, currently unimplemented, will be an ant task to 
build the payload'd jar in the first place. Also a Maven plugin.
