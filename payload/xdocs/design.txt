Payload is an bash/ant/jelly script that takes a 'technology' tree and a 
build tree and merges them together to create an executable jar that contains 
the merged tree. It includes PayloadExtractor, which deploys the payload and 
performs search and replace using a supplied properties file.

For optimisation, PayloadExtractor can know the files it should search 
and replace on.

A payload'd jar looks like:

META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
com/generationjava/payload/PayloadExtractor.class
payload/<payload>
interpolate.properties
