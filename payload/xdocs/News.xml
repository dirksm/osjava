    <p>2005-05-05: Version <a href="changes-report.html#0.4">0.4</a>, of Payload released. The only improvements are concerning the archive interpolation; it now recurses to archives inside archives ad infinitum, and regular expressions may now be used to specify archives to interpolate inside. </p>

    <p>2005-04-18: Version <a href="changes-report.html#0.3">0.3</a>, of Payload released. Most notably a fix for MS Windows and the ability to interpolate inside archives (zip/war/jar files). </p>
<hr />
    <p>2004-02-04: Version <a href="changes-report.html#0.2">0.2</a>, of Payload released. Recursiveness and interpolation decision both avaiable. </p>
<hr />
    <p>2004-02-03: Version <a href="changes-report.html#0.1">0.1</a>, created but not released. It lacks recursiveness and the decision of which file to perform interpolation on needs to improve. </p>
