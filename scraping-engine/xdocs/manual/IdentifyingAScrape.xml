  <section name="Questions">
    <p>A good way to prepare to create a scrape is to ensure you have answers to the following questions. </p>
    <ol>
      <li>What is the entry point for the scraped data (usually a URL)?</li>
      <li>How many pages need to be scraped?</li>
      <li>How does the user get to thoe pages?</li>
      <li>At what times in the day should the pages be scraped; which days?</li>
      <li>Any login/passwords needed to get to the scraped pages?</li>
      <li>Any business constraints? ie) trying to get the scraped data out in very aggressive timely manner</li>
      <li>How often is the data posted?</li>
      <li>Is the scraper expected to get historical data to fill in missing gaps of data due to downtime?</li>
      <li>It cna be very useful to ask your domain expert for a print up of the pages in question, with the desired data highlighted. </li>
