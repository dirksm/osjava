XML pages are usually going to be well formed, and less likely to change than HTML as you won't have look &amp; feel noise getting in the way of your scraping; however the strategy discussed for <a href="GjScrape.html">GjScrape</a> still may apply.

Failing that, use an XML parser of your choice.

It's non-standard, but I like to use gj-xml; a small, fast and easy API.
