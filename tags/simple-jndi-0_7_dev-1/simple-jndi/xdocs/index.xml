    <section name="simple-jndi">
    <p>A simple implementation of JNDI. It is entirely library based, so no server instances are started, and it sits upon Java .properties files or XML files, so it is easy to use and simple to understand. The .properties/.xml files may be either on the file system or in the classpath. </p>
    <p>Currently simple-jndi depends on 3 external jars. This is being reevaluated to minimise the impact of a simple-jndi download, however creating large amounts of redundant code is also not an answer. The download section provides easy links to download the correct versions of these jars directly. </p>
