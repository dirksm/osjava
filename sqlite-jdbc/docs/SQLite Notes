* SQLite3 uses 4 basic types for it's backend.
  * Strings (the fallback for everything)
  * Ints (2-8 bytes in 2 byte increments)
  * Blobs
  * NULL
* SQLite3 appears to let you make a column of any arbitrary type.  It's up to 
  the interfacing library to interpret them otherwise, keeping in mind the
  fact that the fallback type is a string.
* Blobs can be stored in any column.
