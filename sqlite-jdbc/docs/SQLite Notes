* SQLite3 uses 4 basic types for it's backend.
  * Strings (the fallback for everything)
  * Ints (2-8 bytes in 2 byte increments)
  * Blobs
  * NULL
* SQLite3 appears to let you make a column of any arbitrary type.  It's up to 
  the interfacing library to interpret them otherwise, keeping in mind the
  fact that the fallback type is a string.
* Blobs can be stored in any column.
* sqlite3_column_type() does not return appropriate results from a prepared 
  statement unless it's been stepped into.  The concern here is that this is
  then based upon the data in the current row, rather than on the column
  itself, and thus will vary based upon what row the statement is in.
