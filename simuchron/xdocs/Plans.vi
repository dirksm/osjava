A framework to simulate a plant feed, or line feed, or unit feed, or
whatever into the database.

In a large way it is much like OSJ-scraping-engine in that it provides an
automatic database handler to the written module, a configuration system
and an active element of some kind. This does tend to suggest that an
osj-container could be written to handle running frameworks in my chosen
way.

simulate(Timestamp, Map input)...

isPoint(Timestamp, Map) to decide if it is going to return a value?

plant-id: 52 capacity: 2000 offset(secs) 72 scheduler cron schedule ...

simulate:

void simulator.isPoint(ts, map) Object simulator.simulate(ts, map)

config has (Tablename, csv_file, simulator to use, schedule*)
